# Digital Twin App

A React-based application that gamifies health tracking by creating a digital twin that evolves based on your real-life habits. The app visualizes your health data and provides personalized recommendations through an interactive interface.

## Features

- **Health Visualization**: Interactive display of health metrics using ring charts
- **Model Accuracy Tracking**: Visual representation of how well the digital twin models different body systems
- **AI Chat Interface**: Chat with your digital twin and receive personalized "missions"
- **Improvement Tracking**: See how your activities improve the model's accuracy
- **Life Challenges**: Your digital twin communicates challenges it's "experiencing" based on your data

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-twin-app.git
cd digital-twin-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

The app consists of five main panels:

1. **Health Panel**: Shows overall digital twin health with metrics for health, energy, cognitive function, and stress levels. The avatar image changes based on overall health status.

2. **Model Accuracy Panel**: Displays how well each system model (cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous system, sleep) is fitted to your data.

3. **AI Chat Panel**: Chat with your digital twin. The twin suggests "missions" like "Let's sleep for 7.5 hours for 5 nights to evolve my brain power."

4. **Model Improvement Panel**: Highlights how recent workouts and sleep routines have improved the accuracy of the digital twin model.

5. **Life Challenges Panel**: The digital twin communicates challenges based on your data patterns, such as "I'm feeling tired and anxious all the time."

## Customization

### Avatar Images

Replace the placeholder avatar images in the `public/avatar-images/` directory with your own images to represent different health states.

### Tailwind Theme

Customize the color scheme and other design elements by editing the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Technology Stack

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React (for icons)

## Development Roadmap

- [ ] Add data persistence with local storage or a backend database
- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Add data import from wearable devices
- [ ] Create mobile app version
- [ ] Add more sophisticated health modeling algorithms
